### SIMPLE AND UNLIMITED AFFILIATE LINK MANAGEMENT ###

No complex setup or API is required with this affiliate manager. It’s just another post type in your WordPress dashboard admin and another button on your Visual editor.

When writing blog posts, you can search for the specific affiliate link you created earlier by name.

You can add affiliate referral links to Simple URLs while you are writing blog posts. Its customizations won’t hurt your SEO either.

### SUPERIOR LINK REFERRAL TRACKING ###

You can group your affiliate product links into hierarchical categories. E.g., placing all Amazon product links within an “Amazon” category or all popular links in a “Bestsellers” category. 

Managing your links in Simple URLs means there is only one place to change the destination URL if required rather than going back and replacing the link in potentially hundreds of articles. 

### NO LINK CONFLICTS AND EASY AFFILIATE MANAGEMENT ###

Uses proper custom post types to avoid link conflicts with your referral URLs that can occur with other solutions.

Keeps its database footprint small to ensure you don’t over bloat your database with useless HTML. 

### SAFE REDIRECTS & SMART UNCLOAKING ###

You can choose different templates from 301 (default), 302, or 307 redirects, all of which are safe link redirects.

Link redirects protect your affiliate links from being scraped and replaced by malware in your visitor’s browser.

There is also a smart uncloaking feature, so if the affiliate program you are using (e.g., Amazon affiliate program or another 3rd party) does not like your links behind a redirect, you can still use Simple URLs. Your affiliate id can be conditionally uncloaked on the front end. 

And unlike plugins like AAWP and EasyAzon, you can use Simple URLs for both Amazon and non-Amazon products.

### CLICK TRACKING ###

This WordPress affiliate plugin adds click tracking to your links (e.g., text links product boxes, and product pages) to track every click. 

Comes with built-in reports so you can explore, over time, how much your affiliate links have been clicked and what is popular on your site.
